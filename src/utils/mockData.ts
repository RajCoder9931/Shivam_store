  content: "Proper storage of groceries can extend their shelf life and reduce food waste. Keep fruits and vegetables in separate drawers in your refrigerator as many fruits release ethylene gas which can cause vegetables to spoil faster. Store grains and flours in airtight containers to prevent moisture and pests. Oils should be kept away from direct sunlight to prevent them from going rancid.",
